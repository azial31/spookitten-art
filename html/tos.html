				<h2>.:About Work:.</h2>
				<p class="p3">- I take the commission in reservations from the 25th every month until the 5th of the following month.<br/>- if you reserved I ask for part of the price or the totality of the price of the order to block the place.<br/>- I have quite a long waiting list. a reservation does not mean that your order will be made in the month!<br/>- from the moment I start your drawing, the waiting time can be estimated on average from 2 weeks to 1year. (you will therefore have to know how to be patient because you are not alone and I have a life.)<br/>- if you want to stop working with me because you think the time is too long I DO NOT MAKE A REFUND<br/>- I only accept 3 free major modifications on the entire drawing. the other modifications will be charged at the price of 5â‚¬</p>

			<section id="About Me">
				<h2>.:About Me:.</h2>
				<p class="p3">you should know that I am slow enough to produce large pieces. moreover I have requests regularly so the waiting list can be long and the wait can last up to several months, having to receive a finished part.<br/>So I ask you to show kindness and not to remind me every day.</p>
